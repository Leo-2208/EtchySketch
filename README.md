### Details

This project is an extended version of an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project). *The website is built purely using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.*  
[iro.js](https://iro.js.org/) was used to create the beautiful color picker.

Special thanks to [Rahul Chakraborty](https://twitter.com/HckmstrRahul) for designing the site.
